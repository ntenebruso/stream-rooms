## Installation

Please refer to the [Mediasoup documentation](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/installation/#requirements) for system development requirements.

## Running on Windows

While Mediasoup technically *can* run natively on Windows, I would highly recommend using the [Windows WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) because installing Mediasoup on Windows natively requires much more work and will often fail.
